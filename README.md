# C# Blog Webjam

This is the 2nd coding jam we did as a group of friends. The goal was to create a blog in a webenvironment we are not familiar with. 

Because dotNet 5 comes out in a couple of months at the time of writing, I chose to do it with C# and Svelte. 

## The things we decided:
### Requirements
  * Must use a JS Frontend Framework
  * Website must be a blog
  * Website must use a CRUD API
  * No CORS errors on page

### Rules
  * No templates.
  * Webdevs aren't allowed to use familiar frameworks.
  * No PHP.
  * Project must be on GIT

### Time
  * 7 May - 22 May
